# Velaanmai

A dynamic system that is deployed using an IoT kit. The retrieved values from the cloud are explicated by a sophisticated machine learning model and provide insights to the farmers through an android application in making decision whether to sow a particular seed or not based upon the geography and the current scenario of the physical land.

## Velaanami App for farmers

The android application's content is provided in both Tamil and English and also provides voice assist in Tamil for farmers who can't read.The app
provides features such as weather information both short and long term as well as the report based on the geographic conditions for various set of categorized crops.

## Backend

The values from the IoT sensors(Light sensor, pH sensor, moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor) is sent to the backend. In backend the analysing script checks these values with the optimum values for the maximum crop yield. If any value is below/above the optimum level, the system provides the farmer with suggestions to maintain the values in their optimum conditions.
amount of rainfall(long term) received in the crop land area is enlightened to the farmer through the application for future planning of water resources. The pest detection AI model is used to monitor the crops from getting attacked by pests. The neural network is trained with multiple most common pests, so that most of the common occuruing pests are covered in terms of protection.
